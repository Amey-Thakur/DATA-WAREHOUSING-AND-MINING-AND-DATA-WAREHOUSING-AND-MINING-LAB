                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Data Warehousing and Mining (CSC603) and DWM Lab (CSL603) are core subjects in the Third Year (Semester VI) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide foundational knowledge of data warehouse architecture, ETL processes, OLAP operations, and various data mining techniques including classification, clustering, and association rule mining.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Data Warehousing and Mining:

- **Introduction to Data Warehousing**: Data warehouse architecture, schemas (Star, Snowflake, Fact Constellation), metadata.
- **OLAP Technology**: OLAP operations (roll-up, drill-down, slice, dice, pivot), OLAP server architectures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, integration, transformation, and reduction techniques.
- **Classification & Prediction**: Decision trees, Bayesian classification, rule-based classification, neural networks.
- **Clustering Analysis**: K-Means, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering (DBSCAN).
- **Association Rule Mining**: Apriori algorithm, FP-Growth, mining multi-level and multi-dimensional associations.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding data warehousing and mining techniques is essential for extracting valuable insights from large datasets. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental DWM concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through DWM and DWM Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

## Data Warehousing and Mining Laboratory

The laboratory component (CSL603) focuses on hands-on implementation of data mining algorithms and data warehousing concepts using tools like WEKA and SQL.

</div>

> [!TIP]
> **Strategic Insight**: The success of any Data Mining project lies in the quality of Data Preprocessing ("Garbage In, Garbage Out"). A robust Data Warehouse schema (Star/Snowflake) is the backbone of efficient OLAP. When implementing algorithms in **WEKA** or **Python**, always prioritize data cleaning, normalization, and correct format conversion (ARFF/CSV) to ensure statistically significant results.
