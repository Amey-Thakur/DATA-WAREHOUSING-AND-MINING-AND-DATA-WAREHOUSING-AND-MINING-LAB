AIM:
Study of complex Data Types used in Web mining and Spatial Mining Applications.

============================================================================================
PART 1: WEB MINING
============================================================================================
Web mining is an application of data mining techniques to find information patterns from
web data. It helps to improve the power of web search engines by identifying web pages
and classifying web documents.

Web mining can be broadly divided into three categories:

1. Web Content Mining:
   - Targets knowledge discovery from traditional collections of multimedia documents
     (images, video, audio) embedded in or linked to web pages.
   - Deals with semi-structured and unstructured data.
   - Two approaches: Agent-based approach and Database approach.

2. Web Structure Mining:
   - Focuses on the analysis of the link structure of the web.
   - Identifies more preferable documents based on hyperlinks (Document A -> Document B).
   - Helps in discovering similarities between web sites or discovering web communities.
   - Can categorize web pages and generate information like similarity and relationships.

3. Web Usage Mining:
   - Predicts user behavior while interacting with the WWW.
   - Discovers user navigation patterns using weblog records.
   - Useful for personalization, system improvement, site modification, and business intelligence.

============================================================================================
PART 2: SPATIAL DATA MINING
============================================================================================
Spatial data mining is the application of data mining to spatial models. It uses geographical
or spatial information to produce business intelligence.

Key Concepts:

1. Spatial Collaboration:
   - Associate co-existence of non-spatial features in a spatial neighborhood.
   - Example: associating contaminated water reservoirs with certain diseases.
   - Discovers spatial neighborhoods where feature instances collocate.

2. Spatial Association:
   - The degree to which things are similarly arranged in space.
   - Analyzed by map overlay or spatial autocorrelation.
   - Strong association implies similar distribution patterns of two phenomena.
   - Useful for spatial prediction and producing regression maps.

PART 3: APPLICATIONS OF WEB MINING
============================================================================================

1. Financial Data Analysis:
   - Design and construction of data warehouses for multidimensional data analysis.
   - Loan payment prediction and customer credit policy analysis.
   - Classification and clustering of customers for targeted marketing.
   - Detection of money laundering and financial crimes.

2. Retail Industry:
   - Multidimensional analysis of sales, customers, products, time, and region.
   - Analysis of effectiveness of sales campaigns.
   - Customer Retention.
   - Product recommendation and cross-referencing of items.

3. Telecommunication Industry:
   - Multidimensional Analysis of Telecommunication data.
   - Fraudulent pattern analysis.
   - Identification of unusual patterns.
   - Mobile Telecommunication services.

4. Biological Data Analysis:
   - Semantic integration of heterogeneous, distributed genomic and proteomic databases.
   - Alignment, indexing, similarity search, and comparative analysis of DNA sequences.
   - Discovery of structural patterns and analysis of genetic networks.

5. Other Scientific Applications:
   - Handling relatively small and homogeneous data sets in geosciences, astronomy, etc.
   - Data Warehouses and data preprocessing.
   - Graph-based mining.
   - Visualization and domain-specific knowledge.

CONCLUSION
============================================================================================
We understood the applications of web mining and spatial mining. We learnt the types of
web mining (Content, Structure, Usage) and the concept of spatial association and
collaboration.
